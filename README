A Google Chrome extension created to show an inline QR code.
I added some features for removing undesired html elements for the use of website on Karsten stores (intent to be just a kiosk catalog).

It uses Kazuhiko Arases javascript library (http://www.d-project.com/) to
draw the QR codes instead of relying on some third-party web API (like
all of the other extensions I looked at. Wtf?).

Installing (for developers):

    * Clone the repository somehwere.
    * Go to chrome://extensions
    * Make sure the "Developer mode" checkbox is on
    * Click "Load unpacked extension"

Building:

    gem install crxmake
    ./pack.rb
